Exercise 3 â€“ Genetic Algorithm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Pseudo-Boolean Optimisation 
(PBO) problems using the IOHexperimenter framework. 

The GA uses:
  - A parent population of size >= 10
  - Tournament selection
  - Uniform crossover
  - Bit-flip mutation
  - Elitism (optional, for preserving the best solutions)

The algorithm is run on benchmark problems (F1, F2, F3, F18, F23, F24, F25) 
with dimension = 100 and a maximum budget of 100,000 evaluations. Results 
are logged for later analysis with IOHanalyzer.
