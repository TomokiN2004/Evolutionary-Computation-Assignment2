        CONTRIBUTIONS FOR EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION GROUP ASSIGNMENT 2  
================================================================================

DISCLAIMER:  
While we collaborated as a group and supported each other throughout the project, 
the following list reflects the primary tasks each member was responsible for 
overseeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 1 - Kamila Azamova (A1864343) 
- Refined and commented the code for the IOH basic functionality tasks (Random Search).  
- Generated and saved the required plots.  


Exercise 2 - Maxwell Busato (A1851532) & Mohit Mittal (A1885648) 
- Maxwell implemented the RLS and (1+1) EA algorithms and updated the IOH functionality tasks.  
- Maxwell generated and saved the required plots.  
- Kamila completed the analysis for the first three functions.  
- Maxwell completed the analysis for the remaining four functions.
- Mohit completed the math proofs for the Random Search, RLS and (1+1) EA algorithms,
  explaining his findings to the group in order to clarify his results. 
- Maxwell corrected errors in the first math proof and formatted both proofs for 
  clarity and consistency.
- Kamila checked over both math proofs for further errors and clarity. 


Exercise 3 - Nethmi Ranathunga (A1895261)
- Implemented a custom Genetic Algorithm and updated the IOH functionality tasks.
- Generated and saved the required plots. 
- Completed the analysis and comparisons for all 7 functions.


Exercise 4 - Tomoki Nonogaki (A1898137) 
- Tomoki implemented both the MMAS and MMAS* algorithms and updated the IOH functionality tasks.
- Maxwell generated and saved the required plots.  
- Tomoki completed the analysis and comparisons for all 7 functions.


Exercise 5 - Emily Carey (A1851030)
- Emily implemented a custom Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm and updated the IOH functionality tasks.
- Kamila generated and saved the required plots.  
- Emily completed the analysis and comparisons for all 7 functions.
