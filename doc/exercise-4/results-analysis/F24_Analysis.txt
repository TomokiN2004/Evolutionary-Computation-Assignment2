MMAS, MMAS*, Random Search, RLS, and OnePlusOne EA all exhibit characteristic 
growth patterns on the Concatenated Trap problem. 

Random Search shows relatively rapid progress in the initial stages, but 
subsequently stagnates, with its best achieved value ultimately stabilising 
around 12.　In contrast, RLS and OnePlusOne EA start slowly but accelerate rapidly. 
RLS stagnates early, whereas OnePlusOne EA achieves slight additional improvements 
through rare multi-point mutations, settling at a final value around 
16.4 – a marginally higher level than RLS.

MMAS and MMAS* exhibit intriguing characteristics compared to these conventional 
methods. Both initially exhibit growth similar to Random Search despite lacking 
pheromone accumulation. Around 20 evaluations, their growth weakens slightly, 
allowing RLS and OnePlusOne EA to overtake them. However, beyond approximately 
50 evaluations, accumulated pheromone enables renewed rapid growth, ultimately 
reaching solution quality levels comparable to RLS and OnePlusOne EA. 
Interestingly, from around 2000 evaluations, MMAS* grew significantly faster 
than MMAS and maintained this advantage until reaching the budget limit of 
100,000. This is likely because MMAS*'s characteristic of updating pheromones 
while referencing the global best-so-far solution enhanced its search towards the 
global optimum solution for this problem.

Overall, Random Search demonstrated the lowest performance, whilst the other 
algorithms exhibited similar final results but distinct growth patterns.
