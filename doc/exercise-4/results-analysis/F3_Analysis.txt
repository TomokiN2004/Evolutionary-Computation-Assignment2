For the Linear Function with Harmonic Weights problem, the comparison of MMAS, MMAS*, OnePlusOne EA, RLS, and Random Search provides clear insight
into each algorithm's capacity to systematically improve solutions. In this setup, each bit contributes to the solution with weights. Therefore, 
algorithms that can reliably identify and preserve improvements are likely to converge faster.
Random Search demonstrates characteristically weak performance, showing only slow incremental gains over the evaluation period. Although some 
early improvements occur by chance; the inability to retain knowledge results in the best-so-far values plateauing far below the global optimum.
And it's finishing with the values around 3500 - 4000.
RLS and OnePlusOne are both well suited for this linear additive problem. Both algorithms exhibit a phase of solution refinement but rapidly climbes
a steep ascent toward the global optimum. 
MMAS and MMAS* grow faster than RLS and OnePlusOne at the beginning despite the thought of them taking more time to grow to accumulate pheromone values
at the beginning. Ascent gets less steep, and they get overtaken by RLS and OnePlusOne EA but they continue to grow gradually. Ultimately both converge
global optimum with consistency similar to RLS and OnePlusOne EA, and much higher than Random Search.
Overall, F3 highlights that all systematic algorithms achieve reliable convergence, while Random Search trails far behind due to its non-accumulative nature.
