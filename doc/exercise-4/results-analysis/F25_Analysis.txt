This analysis corresponds to NK Landscapes' problem. This problem is defined 
with many local optima and it brings a challenge to all algorithms and allows us 
to see the performance trends among them. For F25, the graph reveals clear 
differences in the final performance of each algorithm.

Random Search shows some improvement initially due to its exploratory nature, 
but it quickly stagnates, resulting in low final solution quality. RLS makes 
steady progress at first thanks to its local search mechanism, but the rugged 
and epistatic structure of the problem causes it to plateau. OnePlusOne EA 
demonstrates the most stable growth, ultimately reaching the highest final value 
among all algorithms. Its occasional multi-bit flips allow it to escape from 
local optima more effectively, leveraging the strengths of evolutionary strategies.

The comparison between MMAS and MMAS* shows an interesting result. In this graph, 
MMAS surpasses MMAS* in final performance. This suggests that MMAS, which updates 
pheromone based on the iteration's best solution maintained a better balance 
between exploration and exploitation, helping it avoid premature convergence. On 
the other hand, MMAS*, which focuses on pheromone updating on the global best 
solution may have converged too early to a suboptimal region results in lower 
final solution quality.

This difference can be traced back to each algorithm's pheromone update scheme. 
MMAS*'s strong dependence on the global best increases the risk of losing 
diversity and getting trapped in local optima. Especially in highly multimodal 
landscapes such as this problem. In contrast, MMAS's iterative updating better 
preserved exploration diversity, meaning higher robustness in this problem.

In summary, for F25, OnePlusOne EA outperformed all other algorithms, with MMAS 
and MMAS* next. And RLS and Random Search struggled. The differences between 
MMAS and MMAS* performance shows the trade-off between convergence speed and 
diversity preservation. In problems which have many local optima, maintaining 
diversity leads to superior final results.
