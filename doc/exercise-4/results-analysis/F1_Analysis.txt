For the OneMax problem, the performance trends across MMAS, MMAS*, OnePlusOne EA, RLS, and Random Search show clear patterns that highlight 
both their similarities and fundamental distinctions. The OneMax's simplicity results in most algorithms making steady progress.

Random Search achieves only slight improvement initially, quickly stagnating at suboptimal fitness value due to its inability to exploit accumulated knowledge for systematic progress.
As a result, its best-so-far curves plateau. In contrast, RLS and OnePlusOne EA are efficiently climbing towards the global optimum. 

MMAS and MMAS* are both based on Ant Colony Optimization principles, exhibit a learning curve that initially lags behind RLS and OnePlusOne EA. Early in the evaluation process, MMAS and MMAS* 
demonstrate gradual improvements as pheromone trails adapt, but after sufficient learning, their increases in fitness become more rapid. And it enalbes them to catch up with and closely mirror the 
slopes RLS and OnePlusOne have as the run progresses. Their convergence times are only a step behind the evolutionary algorithms and distinctly superior to Random Search.

In summary, for OneMax, all systematic search algorithms reliably get to optimal solutions with only small differences in speed and consistency. MMAS variants closely match EAs once pheromone guidance 
strengthens and helping their effectiveness on simple landscapes while Random Search falls far behind.
